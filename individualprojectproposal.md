title: Individual Project Proposal
subtitle: Discovering Information in the Wild!
---

**Introduction**
This class is focused on resolving issues related to “Learning in the Wild”, this proposal addresses that theme head-on. Humans have developed an incredible ability to memorize information when it is discovered or memorized in specific locations. This ability is the basis of the incredibly powerful memorization technique known as 'mind palace'. The project I am proposing utilizes this human ability to teach and reinforce information. The application will allow people to walk around and 'discover' information and then have that information tested by visiting a 'quiz house'.

**Background and Idea**
In the summer of 2016 Pokemon Go took over the world. With this project I am hoping to bring the concept explored in that game, location based gaming, to education. The concept is simple, players download an application to their smartphone. While in this application users will see their location on a map and as they walk around the world they can stumble upon information. When a user stumbles on a piece of information he or she can choose to either read the information (one paragraph or so) or listen a narrator read it out to them. The user will then be forced to take a photo of the location where the information was found, this will help develop a specific memory related to the information that they discovered. The information users may discover will however not be tied to the location itself (this is to ensure some level of replay ability as people usually move around the same areas). One possible future feature however is to allow fixed information in certain locations (such as popular tourist spots). Some locations in the world will be permanently considered ‘quiz houses’. When visiting a ‘quiz house’ you will be asked questions on information you have previously been given. You will then be given a score based on how well you answered those questions, this score will then be compared to others who have visited that 'quiz house'.

An important component of this application will be the social aspect that it will provide. If you are walking around with friends you can register in the app that you are walking around as a group and this will unlock special pieces of information. Furthermore, when visiting a ‘quiz house’ together with a group of friends you will all see the same questions on your devices, and these questions could be based on information that any person in your group had previously been given. This therefore requires communication and collaboration.
