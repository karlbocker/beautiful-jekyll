My example of good design at Williams are the crosswalks crossing Route 2. These crosswalks are an integral part of the campus as they serve as the only way for students and faculty to cross between the two parts of campus. Because of this importance the crosswalks do have a unique design.

There are two features that I think makes this crosswalk design 'good'. Firstly, by incorporating the parallel side lines running perpendicular to the road users of the crosswalk are encouraged to not cross diagonally across the road. This therefore ensures that people cross the road in the most direct way possible minimizing the amount of time that it takes them to cross - something which is important given how many people cross the road everyday. A second feature which is unique to these crosswalks is the red text which says **STOP LOOK WAVE**. These words are there as a safety feature, reminding people to look before they cross the road, something which people may do as they cross the road frequently. These words being written in red also makes them stand out (even though they are somewhat faded on the crosswalk picture). By having the words stand out people who may be looking down are immediately made aware that they are approaching the road and the danger inherent in that. 

In *Learning to See* we read about how "good design is aesthetic". I would not go so far as to argue that these crosswalks are beautiful, but I would nonetheless argue that they are well designed. I think this argument lies largely in that they crosswalks *work* well even though they may not be aesthetically *beautiful*. 

To conclude I think it can be said that the Route 2 crosswalks are of good design as they are highly functional and boast features not typically integrated into sidewalks that vastly improves their usability.
